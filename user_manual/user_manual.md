**User Manual**

 

In this document we will outline how a user would be expected to interact with our system, and walk you through the processes available to the user.

Upon entering the website you are greeted with the *Welcome Page*. You may note that not a lot is available to the user at first glance. This is because we have not registered an account yet. To do this we may click the **Register** button in the center of the page, or in the top right hand corner.

​           

​           Upon pressing this, the user is taken to the *Register* page, where they will be prompted to enter their registration details. Assuming they have entered details correctly, they may click **Submit** to register, and be taken to the *Login* page below.

​           From here, they may enter their login details, similar to the previous page. After clicking **Submit** once again, they are redirected to the *Dashboard*. This is where users may see posts that they themselves may create, or that have been created by other users.

​           The Dashboard shows previously written posts in the middle, and above that there is a form to fill out. If you type what you would like to title your post, and then write the body of the post in the second box; you can then hit submit to post your new forum. This does not show up until you refresh the page. You can see who has written which post by viewing the bottom of the posts.

​           You may also delete posts. This is done by pressing the delete button on the threads. This too is only apparent after refreshing the page.

You may have noticed, that the *Navigation Bar* is different after logging in. Now that there is a valid user viewing the website, they have access to more things. If you have a look at the top of the screenshot, you will see we have access to the *Dashboard (*The current page*), Clubs, Profile (*mike in this case*),* and they also have the option to *Logout*. Also, by clicking the **PASII** button in the top left of the screen it will bring them back to the Welcome Page, which looks a bit different now that they are logged in.

​           Namely, the buttons have changed to direct the user to pages that they may access. Moving on from this, We will have a look at the *Clubs* page.

​           Above you can see there is a list; from here you would access posts from individual clubs and societies. In the top right, you will see the *Profile* page, denoted by the profile icon. Clicking this will bring us to the below page:

​           On this page, you can see a users recent posts, their current society membership, their Bio, and an option to delete their account on the bottom. We will return to this later. The last thing on the navbar yet to be talked about is the *Logout* button. This is located in the top right. Upon clicking this we are brought back to a state similar to where we started. The difference being that we already have a registered user.

​           For future use, the user may click on **Login** to access the application as they did previously. Now, given that they stored their details with us, they may want to remove them at some point. For this we will return to the Profile page. If you remember from that screen, there was a form at the bottom.

​           This form prompts you to input your username and to press submit if you would like to delete their account. If this is done incorrectly, the below message will be displayed:

This is to prevent any accidental deletions. When a user deletes their account successfully, they will be brought back to the Welcome Page, where they may register a new account or safely leave the application knowing that their data is gone.

​           If the user tries to log in again with their previous details, they will be met with an error:

​           This concludes our manual, and we hope that you are now confident in how the system works.
