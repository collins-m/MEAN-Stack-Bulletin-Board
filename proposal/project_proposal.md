### Project Description

​	Put A Soc (PASII) In It is a service designed to act as a central hub for society and inter-society communication. It will be designed as a forum and chat website with society specific forums and mega-forums for general use of for clusters of societies. There will also be chat features for each society, allowing them to keep up to date with the latest news. This chat feature may also be extended to inter-society groups for general idea sharing or whatever the users deem necessary.

​	PASII was conceived to solve a communication problem. Whether a student isn't a member of any society, or is a member of multiple, there is a host of benefits to gain from PASII.  Society-less members have access to all public forums, where they can gain information on clubs they would like to join and receive updates on events happening on campus during the week _(This service is provided through emails at the moment, but would receive benefit by having a dedicated space for it)_.

​	PASII would especially help those students who are members of multiple societies, as it can be difficult to keep up to date on all the news from multiple sources. Society members will have access to all public forums, and private forums for their respective societies. In addition to this they will have access to society chats; this includes chat groups specific to their societies and mega-groups that involve multiple societies including their own. 

​	Members will have tags that identify what societies they are a member of when posting on forums, and on their profile pages. Their profiles will contain a record of their activity on the website and a blog section for them to have for their own ideas.

​	The site will have automatic moderation, overseen by human moderators. These moderators may be selected by society members for their respective forums and chat groups. PASII will be a web-based application, users may create their user with their DCU email, and register with the societies that they are a member of. The rest is up to them.

### Learning Challenges

​	Socket.io is a new technology for us, so learning to integrate this for the real-time chat aspect of the project will prove challenging. In addition to this, finding a hosting solution may also prove challenging; if hosting locally doesn't suffice, using Amazon Web services may be required.

​	Also, while not specifically a learning challenge, coordinating with DCU's societies, and informing them of the proposed service would take up most of the offline work.

___

### Hardware/Software Platform

__Hardware:__ 

​	Both development and testing will be done on student laptops.

__Software:__

​	Everything will be done on Windows, as the web app will not be dependent on a particular operating system. Testing will be done on both Chrome and Firefox to ensure it is compatible with both web browsers. AWS may also be used as a hosting platform for full scale implementation.

___

### Special Hardware/Software Requirements

__Hardware:__ 

​	No special hardware requirements appear to be needed.

__Software:__

​	As stated above, AWS may be required for hosting, this will not be an issue as free service are provided to students, and further services are provided on a trial basis _(Covering enough time for both testing and demonstrating)_.
